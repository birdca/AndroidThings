Use [GPIO](https://developer.android.com/things/sdk/pio/gpio.html) to flowing three LEDs (red/green/yellow) lights by controlling delay time and the order of lighting up: 
  - Connecting **red** to **BCM4**
  - Connecting **green** to **BCM17**
  - Connecting **yellow** to **BCM27**
by following [Raspberry Pi 3 Model B I/O Pinout](https://developer.android.com/things/hardware/raspberrypi-io.html)
